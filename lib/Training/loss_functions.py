def unified_loss_function(output_samples_classification, target, output_samples_recon, inp, mu, std, device, args):
    """
    Computes the unified model's joint loss function consisting of a term for reconstruction, a KL term between
    approximate posterior and prior and the loss for the generative classifier. The number of variational samples
    is one per default, as specified in the command line parser and typically is how VAE models and also our unified
    model is trained. We have added the option to flexibly work with an arbitrary amount of samples.

    Parameters:
        output_samples_classification (torch.Tensor): Mini-batch of var_sample many classification prediction values.
        target (torch.Tensor): Classification targets for each element in the mini-batch.
        output_samples_recon (torch.Tensor): Mini-batch of var_sample many reconstructions.
        inp (torch.Tensor): The input mini-batch (before noise), aka the reconstruction loss' target.
        mu (torch.Tensor): Encoder (recognition model's) mini-batch of mean vectors.
        std (torch.Tensor): Encoder (recognition model's) mini-batch of standard deviation vectors.
        device (str): Device for computation.
        args (dict): Command line parameters. Needs to contain autoregression (bool).

    Returns:
        float: normalized classification loss
        float: normalized reconstruction loss
        float: normalized KL divergence
