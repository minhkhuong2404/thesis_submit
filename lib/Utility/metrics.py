    Maintains a confusion matrix for a given calssification problem.
    The ConfusionMeter constructs a confusion matrix for a multi-class
    classification problems. It does not support multi-label, multi-class problems:
    for such problems, please use MultiLabelConfusionMeter.

    Parameters:
        k (int): number of classes in the classification problem
        normalized (boolean): Determines whether or not the confusion matrix
            is normalized or not
